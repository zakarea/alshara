abstract: Large composite integer factorization algorithms still need to be more efficient and, thus, not operate linearly. The RSA popular cryptographic algorithm strength solely depends on factoring the modulus N. This study proposes a technique based on the Fermat factorization theorem to factor modulus N and decreases processing time, obtaining greater algorithmic and storage complexities. We analyse the Fermat factorization theorem and show why it can factorize numbers in constant time complexity (i.e. O(1)) if the difference is slight. We also derive the exact factorization bound for the Fermat factorization method. Furthermore, we link the Fermat factorization with integer sequences and raise further research questions on how our technique can be generalized to factoring N regardless of the difference between the two prime numbers p and q by linking the Fermat factorization theorem with integer sequences. In the end, We address each thought and raise further research questions showing that identifying formulas for some integer sequences can be the key to factoring any composite integer in a linear time.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Proposing a more efficient Fermat factorization technique to enhance large composite integer factorization algorithms, particularly for RSA cryptography. The method decreases processing time and addresses constant time complexity, showcasing its potential for factorizing modulus N. We analyze the Fermat factorization theorem, establish its factorization bound, and connect it with integer sequences. The study raises questions about generalizing the technique for factoring N, independent of the difference between prime numbers p and q. Overall, identifying formulas for integer sequences is emphasized as a potential key to achieving linear time factorization for any composite integer.
